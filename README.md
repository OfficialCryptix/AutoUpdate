# AutoUpdate

Source of my autoupdate tool basically just make your app load this on start then it can check your server (from url u added) if there is a update it will download the update from the server onto your desktop and then extract it and show a messagebox saying its done all u need to do is make a file near this exe called version.txt with the version inside and the server has to have the same otherwise it updates :) very easy to understand and has small size!

ðŸ”¥its very basic but good!
